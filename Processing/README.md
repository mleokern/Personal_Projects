# Leo Kern, Personal Projects, Processing

## This folder contains all the personal projects I have done in the Processing language, a language I originally learned through a class at the University of Texas at Austin,
## CS 324E: Elements of Graphics and Visualization. In order to run any of these scripts, the Processing IDE must be downloaded, and all files will be run through it. Secondly,
## each of these files must be placed in a folder with the same name as the script. Any additional files needed for the script, such as images that are loaded in and displayed,
## must also be in the folder.
